#authentication to a restful api is always a post request!

login_data = resp.json() #gives me the response as a python dictionary () i.e. the json _strong has already been deserialized

#print(login_data)

token = login_data["access"]
#This is the token you will have to copy and paste into the headers of your subsequent authenticated request

#Now that we have the access token let's retrieve all the posts of the logged in user. This is a GET request since we don't write any data to the API
